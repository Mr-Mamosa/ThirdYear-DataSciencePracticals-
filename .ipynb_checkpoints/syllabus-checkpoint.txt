2. Data Frames and Basic Data Pre-processing
- Read data from CSV and JSON files into a data frame.
- Perform basic data pre-processing tasks such as handling missing values and outliers.
- Manipulate and transform data using functions like filtering, sorting, and grouping.

3. Feature Scaling and Dummification
- Apply feature-scaling techniques like standardization and normalization to numerical features.
- Perform feature dummification to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.

4. Hypothesis Testing
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for a given problem.
- Conduct a hypothesis test using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test).
- Interpret the results and draw conclusions based on the test outcomes.

5. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- Perform one-way ANOVA to compare means across multiple groups.
- Conduct post-hoc tests to identify significant differences between group means.

6. Regression and Its Types
- Implement simple linear regression using a dataset.
- Explore and interpret the regression model coefficients and goodness-of-fit measures.
- Extend the analysis to multiple linear regression and assess the impact of additional predictors.

7. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- Build a logistic regression model to predict a binary outcome.
- Evaluate the model's performance using classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- Construct a decision tree model and interpret the decision rules for classification.

8. K-Means Clustering
- Apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar data points into clusters.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using elbow method or silhouette analysis.
- Visualize the clustering results and analyze the cluster characteristics.

9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Perform PCA on a dataset to reduce dimensionality.
- Evaluate the explained variance and select the appropriate number of principal components.
- Visualize the data in the reduced-dimensional space.

10. Data Visualization and Storytelling
- Create meaningful visualizations using data visualization tools.
- Combine multiple visualizations to tell a compelling data story.
- Present the findings and insights in a clear and concise manner.
